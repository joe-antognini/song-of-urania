    We outline the early development of Greek civilization after the Late
    Bronze Age Collapse and how the unique geography of Greece influenced its
    culture, and ultimately, its astronomy. Then we explore the cosmology,
    cosmogony, and astronomy of the earliest Greeks based on the works of Homer
