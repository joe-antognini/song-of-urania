description: |
    We step back and look at Babylon's broader political history and see how
    Babylonian astronomy changes during the rise of the Neo-Babylonian Empire
    and the Persian Conquest. Then we look at some of the types of astronomical
    records the Babylonians produced, particularly the Astronomical Diaries,
    the longest continuous research program of any society in history.
