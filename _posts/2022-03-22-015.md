description: Before leaving the world of the Pre-Socratics, we look briefly at the
  astronomy of Oenopides, which had a more observational character than many of his
  contemporaries. Then we turn to Plato, the first of the great astronomers in the
  Socratic tradition, whose astronomy synthesized the best ideas of his predecessors.
