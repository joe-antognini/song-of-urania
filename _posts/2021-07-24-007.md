description: |
    As we start to examine the astronomy of Ancient Greece we hear of the myth
    cycles of Theseus and Perseus, episodes from both of which appear in the
    night sky. These myth cycles help us to understand the conception the
    ancient Greeks had to the civilizations that came before them, the Minoans
    and the Mycenaeans and prepare us for the early cosmology of ancient
    Greece.
