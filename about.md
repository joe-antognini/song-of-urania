The Song of Urania is a podcast about the history of astronomy from antiquity
to the present.  New episodes are released every full moon.  The goal of the
podcast is to deeply understand the development of the oldest of the sciences
--- astronomy.  The podcast examines not only the ideas that succeeded, but
also those that failed.  I want to know what questions astronomers were
interested in over the ages and how they tried to answer those questions.

## Who am I?

My name is [Joe Antognini](https://joe-antognini.github.io).  I have a B.S. in
astrophysics from Caltech and a Ph.D. in astronomy from Ohio State, but no
formal training in history apart from a few classes I took in college.  These
days I no longer do astronomy professionally, but work at a startup called
[Whisper](https://whisper.ai) where we are using machine learning to make a
better hearing aid.

## Sources

I use a variety of sources for each episode.  For the earlier episodes that
cover ancient astronomy (particularly Babylonian astronomy) I unfortunately
have to rely on secondary sources more heavily than I would like.  But as we
come closer to modern times I hope to read through more of the primary sources. 

Below is a partial list of sources that I have generally found useful for the
history of astronomy.  In the future I will also include sources specific to
particular episodes in each episode's webpage.

* Aaboe, Asger: *Episodes from the Early History of Astronomy* (2001).  This
  book derives the math behind Babylonian planetary calculations and the
  Ptolemeic model.
* Dreyer, John Louis Emil: [*A History of Astronomy from Thales to
  Kepler*](https://archive.org/details/historyofastrono0000drey) (1906).  An
  excellent broad overview of the history of astronomy up to the time of Kepler
  with a particular focus on the Greeks.
* Heath, Thomas: [*Aristarchus of
  Samos*](https://archive.org/details/aristarchusofsam00heatuoft) (1913).  This
  is a far broader history of astronomy than its title suggests.  Heath covers
  the ideas of many Greek astronomers in detail, culminating in Aristarchus of
  Samos.
* Heath, Thomas: [*Greek
  Astronomy*](https://archive.org/details/heath-1937-greek-astronomy).  A
  collection excerpts from the primary sources of Greek astronomy.
* Kelley, David & Milone, Eugene: *Exploring Ancient Skies* (2011).  An
  up-to-date survey of archaeoastronomical research, covering the astronomy of
  cultures across the globe.
* Magli, Giulio: *Archaeoastronomy* (2016).  An introduction into the methods
  of archaeoastronomy, along with a brief survey of the astronomy of Egypt, the
  Americas, the Greeks, and Paleolithic peoples in the Mediterranean.
* Mason, Stephen: [*A History of the
  Sciences*](https://archive.org/details/historyofscience00maso) (1962).  A
  broad and now somewhat dated history of science from the Babylonians to the
  1800s.
* McLeod, Alexus: *Astronomy in the Ancient World* (2016).  A survey of the
  astronomy of ancient China, pre-Colombian America, India, and Europe.
* Neugebauer, Otto: *Astronomy and History: Selected Essays* (1983).  An
  anthology of papers written by one of the great 20th century scholars of
  Babylonian astronomy.
* Oestmann, GÃ¼nther, Rutkin, H. Darrel, & von Stuckrad, Kocku: *Horoscopes and
  Public Spheres: Essays on the History of Astrology* (2005).  A collection of
  essays on the history of astrology, covering Greek, Hebrew, Babylonian,
  Islamic, and European astrology.
* Pannekoek, Anton: [*A History of
  Astronomy*](https://archive.org/details/historyofastrono0000pann) (1961).  A
  broad and fairly detailed history of western astronomy from the Babylonians
  up to the early 1900s.  If you had to choose one book to read, I would
  recommend this one.
* Pecker, Jean-Claude: *Understanding the Heavens* (2001). A history of how
  cosmological ideas have changed from the time of the ancient Greeks to the
  late 20th century.
* Selin, Helaine: *Astronomy across Cultures* (2000).  An anthology of essays
  on the astronomy of a number of non-Western cultures, including the astronomy
  of Tibet, Korea, and sub-Saharan Africa.
* Thurston, Hugh: *Early Astronomy* (1994). An introduction to the astronomy of
  the ancient West (though a chapter on Mesoamerica is also included).
