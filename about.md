The Song of Urania is a podcast about the history of astronomy from antiquity
to the present.  New episodes are released every full moon.  The goal of the
podcast is to deeply understand the development of the oldest of the sciences
--- astronomy.  The podcast examines not only the ideas that succeeded, but
also those that failed.  I want to know what questions astronomers were
interested in over the ages and how they tried to answer those questions.

## Who am I?

My name is [Joe Antognini](https://joe-antognini.github.io).  I have a B.S. in
astrophysics from Caltech and a Ph.D. in astronomy from Ohio State, but no
formal training in history apart from a few classes I took in college.  These
days I no longer do astronomy professionally, but work at a startup called
[Whisper](https://whisper.ai) where we are using machine learning to make a
better hearing aid.

## Sources

I use a variety of sources for each episode.  For the earlier episodes that
cover ancient astronomy (particularly Babylonian astronomy) I unfortunately
have to rely on secondary sources more heavily than I would like.  But as we
come closer to modern times I hope to read through more of the primary sources. 

Below is a partial list of sources that I have generally found useful for the
history of astronomy.  In the future I will also include sources specific to
particular episodes in each episode's webpage.

* Aaboe, Asger: *Episodes from the Early History of Astronomy*.  This book
  derives the math behind Babylonian planetary calculations and the Ptolemeic
  model.
* Dreyer, John Louis Emil: *A History of Astronomy from Thales to Kepler*.  An
  excellent broad overview of the history of astronomy up to the time of Kepler
  with a particular focus on the Greeks.
* Heath, Thomas: *Aristarchus of Samos*.  This is a far broader history of
  astronomy than its title suggests.  Heath covers the ideas of many Greek
  astronomers in detail, culminating in Aristarchus of Samos.
* Heath, Thomas: *Greek Astronomy*.  A collection excerpts from the primary
  sources of Greek astronomy.
* Hunger, Hermann & Steele, John: *The Babylonian Astronomical Compendium
  Mul.Apin*.  A translation and analysis of the Mul.Apin Babylonian tablets.
* Kelley, David & Milone, Eugene: *Exploring Ancient Skies*.  An up-to-date
  survey of archaeoastronomical research, covering the astronomy of cultures
  across the globe.
* Magli, Giulio: *Archaeoastronomy*.  An introduction into the methods of
  archaeoastronomy, along with a brief survey of the astronomy of Egypt, the
  Americas, the Greeks, and Paleolithic peoples in the Mediterranean.
* Mason, Stephen: *A History of the Sciences*.  A broad and now somewhat dated
  history of science from the Babylonians to the 1800s.
* McLeod, Alexus: *Astronomy in the Ancient World*.  A survey of the astronomy
  of ancient China, pre-Colombian America, India, and Europe.
* Neugebauer, Otto: *Astronomy and History: Selected Essays*.  An anthology of
  papers written by one of the great 20th century scholars of Babylonian
  astronomy.
* Oestmann, GÃ¼nther, Rutkin, H. Darrel, & von Stuckrad, Kocku: *Horoscopes and
  Public Spheres: Essays on the History of Astrology*.  A collection of essays
  on the history of astrology, covering Greek, Hebrew, Babylonian, Islamic, and
  European astrology.
* Pannekoek, Anton: *A History of Astronomy*.  A broad and fairly detailed
  history of western astronomy from the Babylonians up to the early 1900s.  If
  you had to choose one book to read, I would recommend this one.
* Pecker, Jean-Claude: *Understanding the Heavens*. A history of how
  cosmological ideas have changed from the time of the ancient Greeks to the
  late 20th century.
* Selin, Helaine: *Astronomy across Cultures*.  An anthology of essays on the
  astronomy of a number of non-Western cultures, including the astronomy of
  Tibet, Korea, and sub-Saharan Africa.
* Thurston, Hugh: *Early Astronomy*. An introduction to the astronomy of the
  ancient West (though a chapter on Mesoamerica is also included).
* Watson, Rita & Horowitz, Wayne: *Writing Science before the Greeks*. A
  translation and study of the Babylonian Mul.Apin tablets.
