The Song of Urania is a podcast about the history of astronomy from antiquity
to the present.  New episodes are released every full moon.  The goal of the
podcast is to deeply understand the development of astronomy, the oldest of the
sciences.  The podcast examines not only the ideas that succeeded, but also
those that failed.
